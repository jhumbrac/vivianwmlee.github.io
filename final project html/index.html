    <h1>Little Lotte Love</h1>

	<p>
	<h2>Eat</h2>	
	Food can often be a huge source of anxiety when you have a toddler.  What they eat, when they eat, are they even eating&#133;?  Fortunately, Lotte isn&#8217;t too fussy.  She&#8217;ll give anything a try.  If she doesn&#8217;t like it, cool, but when she does like it, she likes it a lot&#x21;  Here are a few of her favourites&#133;

	<h2>Play</h2>
	I can get so mesmerized watching Lotte play.  I love her look of concentration and focus, when she&#8217;s trying to build, or colour, or create something new.  I confess that as a Montessori parent, I prefer toys that encdourage her own imagination.  The blinking, beeping and talking toys can be fun, but I guess I&#8217;m old school.  I like knowing she can create her own sounds and her own scenarios.  Here are a few of her favourites&#133;

	<h2>Wear</h2>
	About a year ago, I was inspired by a fellow mom who was sewing these amazing clothes for her daughter.  Like, really cute, playful clothes.  Plus an awesome Hallowe&#8217;en costume!  I thought hey- I could do that too&#x21;  So I learned to sew.  I tell ya, if it wasn&#8217;t for YouTube tutorials and sewing blogs out there, I wouldn&#8217;t have learned to stitch a thing.  Here&#8217;s a sample of what I&#8217;ve #sewnwithlove...

	<h2>Go</h2>
	We like to go places.  We like to take Lotte with us.  Before she turned 2, she had already been to New York, Chicago, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vancouver, Paris and London.  She has a Nexus card.  If we can instill anything into Lotte at all, it would be the love of food and travel.  And when we take her places both at home and abroad, there are 2 things we would never think of leaving home without...
